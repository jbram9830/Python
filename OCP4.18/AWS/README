Deploy OCP 4.18 on AWS

---

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

### 1. **AWS Setup**
- AWS account with necessary IAM permissions.
- A user with programmatic access (access key ID and secret access key).
- An existing domain or subdomain (e.g., `openshift.example.com`) for OpenShiftâ€™s public route DNS.
- (Optional) A public hosted zone in Route 53 if you want OpenShift to manage DNS.

### 2. **Local Machine**
- Linux/macOS or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- Installed:
  - [OpenShift Installer](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/)
  - [oc CLI](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/)
  - [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
  - `jq` and `openssh`

---

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. **Download OpenShift Installer & CLI**
Download the correct version (4.18) from:

- [Installer & oc CLI](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/4.18/)

Unpack and move them to a directory in your `$PATH`, e.g.:

```bash
chmod +x openshift-install oc
sudo mv openshift-install oc /usr/local/bin/
```

### 2. **Configure AWS CLI**
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your access key, secret key, region (e.g., us-east-1), and output format
```

### 3. **Create an Install Config**
```bash
openshift-install create install-config --dir=mycluster
```

You'll be prompted to input:
- Platform: AWS
- Region
- Base domain (e.g., `example.com`)
- Cluster name (e.g., `openshift`)
- Pull secret (from [Red Hat cloud console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret))
- SSH key (used to access nodes)

This generates a file at `mycluster/install-config.yaml`.

---

### 4. **(Optional) Edit `install-config.yaml`**

You can customize:
- Machine types
- Replica counts
- Networking

Once satisfied, you can proceed.

**Important:** Backup this file as it gets deleted after the next step.

---

### 5. **Create the Cluster**
```bash
openshift-install create cluster --dir=mycluster --log-level=info
```

This will:
- Create infrastructure on AWS
- Launch EC2 instances
- Set up networking, load balancers, and DNS (if Route 53 is integrated)
- Deploy OpenShift components

This process takes **30â€“45 minutes**.

---

### 6. **Access the Cluster**
After completion, the installer will display:
- Console URL
- Admin credentials

Example:
```
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user...
```

Login with `oc`:
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=mycluster/auth/kubeconfig
oc whoami
```

---

### 7. **Post-Install Tasks**
- Create users and configure identity providers
- Set up cluster monitoring and logging
- Configure persistent storage if needed

---

##  Notes

- **Destroy Cluster** (Cleans up all resources):
```bash
openshift-install destroy cluster --dir=mycluster
```

- Make sure you monitor AWS costsâ€”OpenShift clusters can generate significant usage.
